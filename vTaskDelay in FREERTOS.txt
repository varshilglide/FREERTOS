--> Syntax for delay():

vTaskDelay(1000); 
--> It gives 1 second delay. but in this it is not give us accurate 1 sec delay so for that below syntax gives us accurate 1 sec delay.

vTaskDelay(1000*configTICK_RATE_HZ / 1000);
--> It gives us accurate delay of 1 sec. But still here It did not give us accurate delay and delay is arround sometimes 1000, 1010 , 1015 miliseconds.

==> So for precise result of it we using Delayuntil function.

void myTask1 (void *p)
{
TickType_t myLastUnblock;
myLastUnblock = xTaskGetTickCount();
int count = 0;

while(1)
{
printf("hello, world!: %d\r\n", count++);
vTaskDelayUntil(&myLastUnblock, 1000 * configTICK_RATE_HZ / 1000);
}
}
